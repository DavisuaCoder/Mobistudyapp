      If you download Mobistudy to your phone, the app will collect the following information
      from you, regardless of whether you have joined any research study or not:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your email address.
          This is needed to identify you, allow you to login and to recover your password.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your date of birth.
          This is needed to match your profile with the inclusion criteria of available studies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your gender.
          This is also needed to match your profile with the inclusion criteria of available studies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Technical logs indicating the time you have accessed the system and what data you have sent.
          These are needed for security reasons and will be kept for 1 year in all circumstances, also if you decide to delete your account.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      These data will be securely transferred (via HTTPS) and stored on a server
      hosted and managed by the University of Oxford. Personnel from the University
      of Oxford may access the server and your data for technical maintenance, but
      will not download or analyse any of these data.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use Gmail for managing the emails sent by Mobistudy.
      This means that your email address, together with the content of the email sent
      by us will be managed by Google according to their Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you decide to join a research study, further study-specific conditions will
      apply, which will be clearly shown to you when consenting to participate in the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under no circumstances other than the ones specified above, will your data be shared with other parties or individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can remove your profile from Mobistudy whenever you want. This will remove all your data, except the technical logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can download the data in a machine-readable format. Contact carmelo.velardo@eng.ox.ac.uk if you need to.
    </p>
    <p>
      All your data will be removed after 3 years from your registration or from the
      end of any study you joined while using the Mobistudy app, whichever is the latest.
