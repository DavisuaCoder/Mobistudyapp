            "en": "Smart monitoring devices and mobile-health (mHealth) technologies are used more and more to help with asthma self-management. These technologies, including smartwatches and smartphones, give new ways for people with asthma to monitor their condition with the least interruption to their lives. Smart devices can replace the burden of daily monitoring, helping people to look after their asthma so that they manage their treatment and avoid attacks. Examples are smart inhalers and smart watches.\n\nTo develop a useful and safe system for people with asthma, we need to collect information using new smart technologies alongside the traditional daily symptom and peak flow diary. We can then compare the two sets of readings to develop systems that detect worsening asthma using smart devices and potentially reducing the need for burdensome data entry.\n\nThe aim of this study is to collect these two sets of data from about 30 people for 6 months. We’ll use the findings to develop a method that can accurately predict an asthma attack smart devices and symptom diaries. In the future this could be used in a connected asthma system to help people look after their asthma and avoid troublesome attacks. \n",
