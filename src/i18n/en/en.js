    introductionFull: `Mobistudy is an open iniative that allows citizens to help \
    health research with their data. Participants download an app (iOS or Android) \
    and, after registering and filling-in a short profile, they are proposed with \
    research studies. If they find a study they may be interested in, they are \
    guided through an easy-to-understand informed consent process. Upon acceptance, \
    participants are then proposed "tasks", such as filling forms and questionnaires \
    and provide their health data through Google Fit or Apple HealthKit.<br><br>
    Mobistudy is currently managed by the Internet Of Things and People research\
    center, Malm√∂ University.`
