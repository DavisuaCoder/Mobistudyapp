      Introduction
    </div>
    <p>
      Mobistudy is an open iniative that allows citizens to help health research
      with their data.
      Participants download an app (iOS or Android) and, after registering and filling-in
      a short profile, they are proposed with research studies.
      If they find a study they may be interested in, they are guided through an
      easy-to-understand informed consent process.
      Upon acceptance, participants are then proposed "tasks", such as filling forms
      and questionnaires and provide their health data through Google Fit or Apple HealthKit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mobistudy is currently managed by the Institute of Biomedical Engineering,
      University of Oxford.
