          <q-item-label caption>Mobistudy is an open iniative that allows citizens to help health research with their data. Participants download an app (iOS or Android) and, after registering and filling-in a short profile, they are proposed with research studies. If they find a study they may be interested in, they are guided through an easy-to-understand informed consent process. Upon acceptance, participants are then proposed "tasks", such as filling forms and questionnaires and provide their health data through Google Fit or Apple HealthKit.</q-item-label>
